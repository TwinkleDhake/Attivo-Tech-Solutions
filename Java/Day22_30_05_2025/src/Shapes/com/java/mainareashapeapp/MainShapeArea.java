/* Q2. Write a program that demonstrates the use of Java packages by creating a package for geometric shapes and 
using it in another package to calculate the area of shapes.
Create a package named shapes containing two classes:
Circle with:
A public method calculateArea(double radius) that calculates and returns the area of a circle.
Formula: area = Ï€ * radius * radius.
Rectangle with:
A public method calculateArea(double length, double width) that calculates and returns the area of a rectangle.
Create another package named mainapp containing a class MainApp with a main method that:
Prompts the user to input the dimensions of a circle and a rectangle.
Uses the shapes.Circle and shapes.Rectangle classes to calculate and print their areas.
Requirements:
Use the import statement to access the shapes.Circle and shapes.Rectangle classes from the mainapp.MainApp class.
Ensure the methods in Circle and Rectangle are accessible from the MainApp class.
Hint:
Use the public modifier for the add method so that it can be accessed across packages. */
